I need to add a method for switching shaders. I think I'll create a struct of shader/pipeline information, 
then apply those structs on createCommandBuffers. Then I'll give each of those shader infos a list of meshes that are bound
to them. When calling createCommandBuffers, I'll do a for loop for every frame in the swapchain, then a for loop
for every shader, and then a for loop for every mesh in that shader. This will mean I will have to assign shaders before creating
the command buffers.
